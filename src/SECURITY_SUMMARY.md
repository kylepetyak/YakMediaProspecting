## 🔧 **How It Works**

### **Authentication Flow:**
1. User visits a protected page (e.g., `/dashboard`)
2. If not logged in → Redirected to `/login`
3. User enters email/password
4. Supabase validates credentials
5. Session is created and stored
6. User can access protected pages
7. Session persists across browser sessions

### **Public Reports:**
- Reports at `/:slug` are **intentionally public**
- No login required to view reports
- Perfect for sharing with prospects
- URLs are clean and branded: `success.yak.media/#/company-name`

## 🔧 **Optional: Lock Down /create-user Page**

By default, `/create-user` is **public** so you can easily create accounts during setup.

**To make it protected (recommended after initial setup):**

1. Open `/App.tsx`
2. Find this line:
   ```tsx
   <Route path="/create-user" element={<CreateUserPage />} />
   ```
3. Change it to:
   ```tsx
   <Route path="/create-user" element={<ProtectedRoute><CreateUserPage /></ProtectedRoute>} />
   ```
4. Now only logged-in users can create new accounts
