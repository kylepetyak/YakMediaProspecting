# üö® URGENT: Fix Your GitHub Repo

## The Problem

You pushed **broken code** to GitHub. The `_redirects` file is a **directory** with `.tsx` files inside instead of a plain text file.

This will cause **routing to fail** on Netlify. Clean URLs won't work.

---

## Fix It Now (2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Check Your Local Repo

Open your local project folder and look at `public/_redirects`

**If it's a folder:**
```bash
public/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ _redirects/
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Code-component-40-59.tsx  ‚Üê BAD!
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Code-component-40-74.tsx  ‚Üê BAD!
```

**It should be a FILE:**
```bash
public/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ _redirects  ‚Üê GOOD! (no folder, just a file)
```

---

### Step 2: Delete the Bad Directory

**On Mac/Linux:**
```bash
cd public
rm -rf _redirects
```

**On Windows:**
```bash
cd public
rmdir /s _redirects
```

---

### Step 3: Create the Correct File

**On Mac/Linux:**
```bash
echo "/* /index.html 200" > _redirects
```

**On Windows:**
```bash
echo /* /index.html 200 > _redirects
```

**Or just create it manually:**
1. Create a new file called `_redirects` (no extension!)
2. Put this ONE line inside:
   ```
   /* /index.html 200
   ```
3. Save it

---

### Step 4: Verify It's Correct

**On Mac/Linux:**
```bash
cat _redirects
```

**On Windows:**
```bash
type _redirects
```

You should see:
```
/* /index.html 200
```

---

### Step 5: Push to GitHub

```bash
git add public/_redirects
git commit -m "Fix _redirects file - convert from directory to plain text file"
git push
```

---

### Step 6: Wait for Netlify to Rebuild

1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Watch the deployment
3. It should automatically rebuild with the fixed file
4. Check your site - clean URLs should now work!

---

## How Did This Happen?

**You edited `/public/_redirects` in Figma Make.**

Figma Make doesn't understand plain text files, so it turns them into directories with `.tsx` files inside.

**Solution: NEVER edit `_redirects` in Figma Make again.**

---

## Verify Your GitHub Has the Fix

Go to your GitHub repo and check:
```
https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO/blob/main/public/_redirects
```

**It should show:**
- ‚úÖ A **file** (not a folder)
- ‚úÖ Contains: `/* /index.html 200`

**If you see a folder:**
- ‚ùå You didn't fix it yet
- ‚ùå Go back to Step 2

---

## After Fixing

Your Netlify build will succeed and:
- ‚úÖ `success.yak.media/dashboard` works
- ‚úÖ `success.yak.media/companyname` works (clean URLs!)
- ‚úÖ No more 404s on page refresh

---

## Prevention

**NEVER** touch the `_redirects` file in Figma Make.

If you need to make changes:
1. Make them in your **local repo** or **GitHub directly**
2. NOT in Figma Make

The file is already perfect. Leave it alone.

---

## Still Not Working?

### Check Netlify Build Logs

1. Go to Netlify dashboard
2. Click on your site
3. Click "Deploys"
4. Click the latest deploy
5. Look for errors in the build log

### Common Issues:

**"_redirects is not a file"**
- You didn't fix it yet
- Delete the directory, create the file

**"Module not found" errors**
- Run `npm install` in your local repo
- Make sure all dependencies are in `package.json`

**Clean URLs still don't work**
- Clear browser cache
- Try incognito/private window
- Check the actual URL in the address bar

---

## Need to Start Over?

If your GitHub repo is too messed up:

1. **Delete the repo on GitHub**
2. **Export fresh code from Figma Make**
3. **Before pushing:**
   - Check that `public/_redirects` is a FILE, not a folder
   - Open it and verify it contains: `/* /index.html 200`
4. **Push to GitHub**
5. **Deploy to Netlify**

---

## Summary

1. ‚úÖ Delete `public/_redirects` directory
2. ‚úÖ Create `public/_redirects` file with one line
3. ‚úÖ Push to GitHub
4. ‚úÖ Netlify rebuilds automatically
5. ‚úÖ Your site works!

**Do this NOW before your Netlify build fails.**
