# Hosting Setup for Clean URLs

## The Problem

You're using `BrowserRouter` which creates clean URLs like:
- ✅ `success.yak.media/companyname`

But BrowserRouter requires **server-side configuration** to work. When someone visits `success.yak.media/companyname` directly, your server needs to serve the `index.html` file instead of looking for a file called `companyname`.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Configure Your Hosting (Recommended)

Keep the clean URLs by configuring your hosting provider.

#### **Netlify**
Create `/public/_redirects`:
```
/*    /index.html   200
```

#### **Cloudflare Pages**
Create `/public/_redirects`:
```
/*    /index.html   200
```

#### **AWS S3 + CloudFront**
In CloudFront, set error pages:
- Error Code: 403, 404
- Response Page: /index.html
- Response Code: 200

#### **GitHub Pages**
Create `/public/404.html` that redirects to index.html:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <script>
      sessionStorage.redirect = location.href;
    </script>
    <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;URL='/'"></meta>
  </head>
</html>
```

#### **Firebase Hosting**
In `firebase.json`:
```json
{
  "hosting": {
    "rewrites": [
      {
        "source": "**",
        "destination": "/index.html"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### **Apache (.htaccess)**
```apache
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteBase /
  RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
  RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
</IfModule>
```

#### **Nginx**
```nginx
location / {
  try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
}
```

### Option 2: Use HashRouter (No Server Config Needed)

If you can't configure your hosting, switch to HashRouter. URLs will be:
- `success.yak.media/#/companyname`

**Pros:**
- ✅ Works on any hosting without configuration
- ✅ No server setup needed
- ✅ Works everywhere immediately

**Cons:**
- ❌ URLs have `#` in them
- ❌ Less SEO-friendly
- ❌ Looks less professional

## Which Hosting Provider Are You Using?

To help you fix this, I need to know:
1. **Where is your app hosted?** (Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, AWS, etc.)
2. **Where is the CNAME pointing?** What service is serving `success.yak.media`?

Once you tell me, I can provide exact instructions!

## Quick Test

To see if your hosting is configured correctly:

1. Deploy your app
2. Visit the root: `success.yak.media` - should work ✅
3. Visit a direct URL: `success.yak.media/test-clinic` - should work ✅ or show 404 ❌

If step 3 shows a 404, your hosting needs configuration!
