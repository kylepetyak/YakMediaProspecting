2. Connect to GitHub
3. Push your code

**Method 2: Download ZIP**
1. Download your code as ZIP
2. Extract it to a folder

---

2. Sign up (free)

7. Click "Deploy site"
8. Wait 2-3 minutes

#### If You Downloaded ZIP:

2. Run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

4. Click "Add new site" ‚Üí "Deploy manually"
5. Drag the `dist` folder to the upload area

### Step 3: Add Your Custom Domain

1. In Netlify, go to **Site settings** ‚Üí **Domain management**
2. Click **"Add custom domain"**
3. Enter: `success.yak.media`
4. Netlify will show you DNS records
5. Go to **GoDaddy** (your domain registrar)

   Name: success
   Value: your-site-name.netlify.app
   TTL: 600
   ```
7. Save and wait 5-30 minutes for DNS to propagate

---

### Step 4: Test Your Site

2. Create your first admin account
3. Login at `https://success.yak.media/login`
4. Create a prospect in the dashboard
5. Share `https://success.yak.media/company-name` with them

**Done! Your app is live!** ‚úÖ

---

## Option B: Keep Testing in Figma Make

If you're not ready to deploy yet:

1. **Use the preview** in Figma Make
2. Clean URLs won't work (`/#/company` instead of `/company`)
3. Share preview links for testing
4. Deploy to Netlify when ready

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Stop Editing `_redirects`

**DO NOT edit `/public/_redirects` in Figma Make ever again.**

It keeps turning into a directory with `.tsx` files which breaks routing.

The file is already correct:
```
/* /index.html 200
```

Leave it alone. I've fixed it (again). Don't touch it.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "My site shows a blank page"
- Check browser console for errors
- Make sure you ran `npm install` before `npm run build`
- Make sure you deployed the `dist` folder, not the source code

### "Clean URLs don't work (getting 404s)"
- Make sure `_redirects` file exists in the `dist/` folder
- Check Netlify build logs
- Clear browser cache

### "Can't login"
- Make sure you set up Supabase (see `DATABASE_SETUP.sql`)
- Check your environment variables in Netlify
- Go to `/initial-setup` first to create admin account

### "Public reports show 404"
- The prospect doesn't exist in your database yet
- Create the prospect in your dashboard first
- Check the slug matches the URL
