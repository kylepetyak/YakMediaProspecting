# üö® Your Netlify Build is Failing - Here's Why

## The Error You're Seeing

```
Build script returned non-zero exit code: 2
Deploy directory 'dist' does not exist
```

This means **the build failed before creating the dist folder**.

---

## Root Cause: TWO Problems

### Problem 1: Broken `_redirects` File (CONFIRMED)

Your GitHub repo has:
```
public/_redirects/          ‚Üê DIRECTORY (BAD!)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Code-component-41-14.tsx
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Code-component-41-24.tsx
```

It should be:
```
public/_redirects           ‚Üê FILE (GOOD!)
```

**This WILL cause the build to fail.**

---

### Problem 2: Build Command Failed

The error `exit code: 2` means `npm run build` crashed.

**You need to see the FULL build logs to know why.**

---

## How to See the REAL Error

The error you pasted is just the END of the log. You need to scroll up.

### In Netlify:

1. Go to **Deploys** tab
2. Click on the failed deployment
3. **Scroll up** in the build log
4. Look for errors BEFORE this line:
   ```
   Failed during stage 'building site'
   ```

### What to Look For:

Common errors:

| Error in Logs | What It Means |
|---------------|---------------|
| `Cannot find module` | Missing dependency |
| `Unexpected token` | Syntax error in code |
| `ENOENT: no such file or directory` | Missing file |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL is not defined` | Missing environment variables |
| `Failed to parse source` | Broken import statement |

---

## Fix It Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Fix `_redirects` in Your Local Repo

**This is REQUIRED. Do it now.**

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /path/to/your/project

# Delete the bad directory
cd public
rm -rf _redirects

# Create the correct file
echo "/* /index.html 200" > _redirects

# Verify it's correct
cat _redirects
# Should show: /* /index.html 200

# Go back to project root
cd ..

# Commit and push
git add public/_redirects
git commit -m "Fix _redirects - convert from directory to file"
git push
```

---

### Step 2: Check Environment Variables

Your app needs these in Netlify:

1. Go to Netlify ‚Üí **Site settings** ‚Üí **Environment variables**
2. Add these:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` = `https://your-project.supabase.co`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` = `your-anon-key`

3. **Trigger a new deploy:**
   - Netlify ‚Üí **Deploys** ‚Üí **Trigger deploy** ‚Üí **Clear cache and deploy**

---

### Step 3: Wait for Rebuild

After you push the fixed `_redirects` file:

1. Netlify will automatically rebuild
2. Watch the build logs
3. Look for the actual error if it still fails

---

## Most Likely Issues

Based on your setup, the build is probably failing because of ONE of these:

### Issue A: `_redirects` is a Directory

**Symptom:** Build fails with module errors

**Fix:** Follow Step 1 above

---

### Issue B: Missing Environment Variables

**Symptom:** Build succeeds but app doesn't work, OR build fails with "undefined" errors

**Fix:** Add environment variables in Netlify (Step 2 above)

---

### Issue C: Import Errors

**Symptom:** `Cannot find module` or `Unexpected token`

**Check your code for:**
- Incorrect import paths
- Missing dependencies in package.json
- Syntax errors

---

### Issue D: Vite Config Problems

Your `vite.config.ts` might have issues.

**Check if you have one.** If not, you might need to create it:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
import path from 'path'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@': path.resolve(__dirname, './'),
    },
  },
})
```

---

## What to Do RIGHT NOW

1. ‚úÖ **Fix `_redirects` in your local repo** (see Step 1)
2. ‚úÖ **Push to GitHub**
3. ‚úÖ **Add environment variables in Netlify** (see Step 2)
4. ‚úÖ **Watch the new build logs**
5. ‚úÖ **If it still fails, paste the FULL logs** (scroll up from the error)

---

## How to Get the Full Build Logs

If the build still fails after fixing `_redirects`:

1. Go to Netlify ‚Üí **Deploys**
2. Click the failed deploy
3. **Copy the ENTIRE log** (not just the last 20 lines)
4. Look for the first error (usually in the middle of the log)

The full log will show:
```
10:02:30 PM: $ npm run build
10:02:31 PM: > build
10:02:31 PM: > vite build
10:02:32 PM: 
10:02:32 PM: [ERROR HERE] ‚Üê This is what you need!
10:02:33 PM: Build failed
...
10:02:55 PM: Deploy directory 'dist' does not exist ‚Üê This is the RESULT, not the CAUSE
```

---

## Stop Making This Worse

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Stop Editing `_redirects` in Figma Make

**Every time you edit `/public/_redirects` in Figma Make, it turns into a directory.**

**I've fixed it 5 times now. Please stop.**

### Where to Edit It:

- ‚úÖ In your **local repo** (on your computer)
- ‚úÖ Directly in **GitHub** (on github.com)
- ‚ùå **NEVER in Figma Make**

---

## After You Fix It

Once the build succeeds, you'll see:

```
‚úÖ Site is live
   https://your-site.netlify.app
```

Then:
1. Test your routes
2. Add custom domain
3. Start prospecting

---

## Need Help?

If the build still fails after:
1. Fixing `_redirects`
2. Adding environment variables
3. Triggering a new deploy

**Then paste the FULL build logs** (not just the last 20 lines) and I can help debug the actual error.

The error you pasted only shows "dist doesn't exist" - but that's because the build failed. We need to see WHY it failed.
