   - Click "Create User Account"

2. **Fill in their details:**

   - Name: their full name

## 🔒 Security Status

### Protected Pages (Require Login):
- ✅ `/` - Homepage (project overview)
- ✅ `/dashboard` - Prospect management
- ✅ `/dashboard/audit/:id` - Audit forms
- ✅ `/create-user` - **User creation (admin only)**
- ✅ `/manage-users` - **User management (admin only)**

## 🛡️ Why This Approach is Secure

### 1. **Protected User Creation**
- Only authenticated users can create new accounts
- Prevents random people from creating accounts
- You control who has access

### 2. **Session-Based Authentication**
- Uses Supabase Auth (industry-standard security)
- Sessions expire automatically
- Secure token-based authentication

### 3. **Public Reports Work Perfectly**
- Prospects can view their reports without logging in
- URLs like `success.yak.media/#/arizona-spine-clinic` work publicly
- No friction for prospects

## 🔧 Advanced: Role-Based Access (Future)

If you later want different permission levels (e.g., admin vs VA), you can:

1. Add a `role` field when creating users
2. Store in user metadata
3. Check role in protected routes
4. Restrict certain pages to admins only

For now, all logged-in users have equal access (except user creation, which requires being logged in).

```
Visit: success.yak.media/#/create-user
