# GoDaddy Hosting Setup - Complete Guide

## ✅ Solution Implemented: HashRouter

Since you're using GoDaddy hosting, I've switched the app to **HashRouter** which works on ANY hosting without configuration.

## 📋 Your URLs Now Look Like:

**Format:** `success.yak.media/#/companyname`

**Examples:**
- Test Clinic → `success.yak.media/#/test-clinic`
- Peak Performance → `success.yak.media/#/peak-performance`
- Arizona Spine → `success.yak.media/#/arizona-spine`

## ✅ What Changed:

1. **App.tsx** - Now uses `HashRouter` instead of `BrowserRouter`
2. **All URL generation** - Updated to include `#` in the URL
3. **Works immediately** - No server configuration needed!

## 🚀 How to Deploy on GoDaddy:

### Option 1: GoDaddy cPanel Hosting

1. Build your app:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Upload the `dist` folder contents to your GoDaddy hosting:
   - Log into cPanel
   - Go to File Manager
   - Navigate to `public_html` (or your domain folder)
   - Upload all files from `dist` folder

3. **That's it!** Your URLs will work immediately.

### Option 2: GoDaddy Website Builder

If you're using GoDaddy's Website Builder (drag & drop), you can't host a React app directly. You need to:

1. Use GoDaddy's hosting service instead (cPanel)
2. OR use a third-party service like:
   - Netlify (free)
   - Vercel (free)
   - Cloudflare Pages (free)
   
Then just point your CNAME `success.yak.media` to that service.

### Option 3: Point CNAME to Netlify/Vercel (Recommended)

**Why this is better:**
- ✅ Free hosting
- ✅ Automatic deployments
- ✅ Better performance
- ✅ Free SSL
- ✅ No server management

**Steps:**

1. **Deploy to Netlify (easiest):**
   - Go to netlify.com
   - Drag & drop your `dist` folder
   - Or connect your GitHub repo for auto-deploy
   - Netlify gives you a URL like `your-app.netlify.app`

2. **Update your GoDaddy DNS:**
   - Go to GoDaddy DNS settings
   - Update the CNAME for `success`:
     - Type: CNAME
     - Name: success
     - Value: `your-app.netlify.app`
     - TTL: 600

3. **Configure custom domain in Netlify:**
   - In Netlify dashboard → Domain settings
   - Add custom domain: `success.yak.media`
   - Netlify will provide SSL automatically

## 📊 URL Comparison:

| Method | URL Format | Pros | Cons |
|--------|-----------|------|------|
| **HashRouter (Current)** | `success.yak.media/#/name` | ✅ Works everywhere<br>✅ No config needed<br>✅ Simple | ❌ Has `#` in URL |
| **BrowserRouter** | `success.yak.media/name` | ✅ Clean URLs<br>✅ Better SEO | ❌ Needs server config<br>❌ Complex on GoDaddy |

## 🎯 Current Status:

✅ **Your app now works with HashRouter!**

**Your URLs:**
- Dashboard: `your-domain.com/#/dashboard`
- Public Reports: `success.yak.media/#/company-slug`

**No more 404 errors!** HashRouter handles all routing client-side.

## 🔄 If You Want Clean URLs (Without `#`):

You have two options:

### Option 1: Deploy to Netlify/Vercel
- Point `success.yak.media` CNAME to Netlify/Vercel
- I can help you switch back to BrowserRouter
- You'll get clean URLs: `success.yak.media/company-name`

### Option 2: Configure GoDaddy cPanel
- If you have cPanel access, add `.htaccess` file (already created for you)
- This is more complex and may not work on all GoDaddy plans

## 💡 My Recommendation:

**Stick with HashRouter!** 

The `#` in the URL is a small trade-off for:
- ✅ Guaranteed to work
- ✅ Zero configuration
- ✅ Works on any hosting
- ✅ No 404 errors
- ✅ Easy to share links

Your prospects won't care about the `#` - they care about the insights in your report!

## 🆘 Need Help?

Let me know if you want to:
1. Deploy to Netlify/Vercel (I'll walk you through it)
2. Test the current setup
3. Switch to clean URLs (requires Netlify/Vercel)
